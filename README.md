# WHAT IS REPURPOSED STRUCTURES?
<br/>

Repurposed Structures is a mod about taking existing vanilla features and structures and creating new variants or modifications to them! Originally, most of the structures and features in this mod was actually made for my Ultra Amplified Dimension mod. but then I realized these features and structures would look great in the Overworld as well so I decided to take those structures and features and split them into their own mod and continue to add MORE biome variants of vanilla structures! And over time, some other people even help contribute more vanilla styled structures!

<br/>

### Currently, this mod has:
<details>

- Jungle Fortresses which are Nether Fortresses using Stonebrick blocks and spawns in Jungles!
- 10 Dungeons variants
- 13 new Mineshaft types
- 10 new biome variants of Villages
- 9 new temples variants
- 2 new biome variants of Igloos
- 13 new Pillager Outposts
- 4 new types of Shipwrecks
- 7 new Mansion types
- 5 new Witch Huts types
- A Nether themed Ocean Ruins
- A Nether themed End City
- A Nether Stronghold
- 5 new Desert Well variations were made for other biomes
</details>
<br/>
<br/>

If you have trouble finding one of these structures, just start typing `/locate repu` into the chat and you should see my structures pop up! For example, typing `/locate repurposed_structures:mansion_birch` will find the closest RS's Birch Mansion to your location. :) All structures can be found easily from anywhere!
<br/>
<br/>

### Frequently Asked Questions:
<details>

Q: Does this mod work with [YUNG's Better Strongholds](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-strongholds-fabric) mod?

<br/>
A: Yes BUT only with latest version of Repurposed Structures. (PLEASE UPDATE REPURPOSED STRUCTURES PEOPLE) When Better Strongholds is on, they will only replace the Overworld Strongholds. RS's Nether Stronghold will still spawn in Nether biomes.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Q: Does this mod work with [YUNG's Better Mineshafts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-mineshafts-fabric) mod?

<br/>
A: Yep! This mod works with YUNG's Better Mineshafts lol. I added code to make our mods compatible. Both of our mineshafts should spawn in the world.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Q: Does this mod conflict with ___ mod?

<br/>
A: Highly unlikely. My mod adds structures to biomes directly so any conflict would be extremely rare. Best way to know is to just try my mod with the other mod. If you find they do conflict somehow, PLEASE let me know so I can investigate and release a fix! :)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Q: The advancements are annoying! I want to turn them off!

<br/>
A: There are datapacks to turn off the advancements or hide them. Scroll down to the "PRE-MADE DATAPACKS" section farther down and open the spoiler to get the disable/hidden advancements datapacks!

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Q: How can I change the language that this mod uses?

<br/>

A: You can use a Resourcepack to add new languages and help contribute! [Click here for more info!](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.8)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Q: Can I use this mod in a modpack?

<br/>
A: Yep! You can use this mod in a modpack :)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Q: Can I modify the source code of this mod to make changes?

<br/>
A: You can but just make sure you respect my license which is LGPL. That means, if you plan on distributing a modified Repurposed Structures jar, you should open source it by making the modified source code visible and licensed under an open source license. But truthfully, if you want to make a change, ask me first or make a PR into my mod as I might actually add it to the base mod itself!

# HOW CAN I CONFIGURE THIS MOD?

<br/>
<br/>

You can configure this mod with configs and datapacks! See the "PRE-MADE DATAPACKS" section further down for already made datapacks that do a bunch of stuff such as turning off advancements!

<br/>
<br/>

You can change the configs by using Mod Menu mod with this mod. Just go into my mod in the list and click the gear. Just be sure to restart you game when you're finished changing configs! If you want to find this mod's config file directly, go into the config folder that is above the mods folder and there will be 1 config file for this mod (but without comments). Then exit/restart Minecraft for all changes to take effect. Do note that the config will affect all worlds so keep that in mind!

<br/>
<br/>

### Config details:

<details>
Right now, there are lots of config options. The big one that you may be interested in is the spawnrate config for every structure and yes, you can even fully turn off the structures too. The config comments will help walk you through on how to adjust the rates. Furthermore, you can even blacklist dimensions or biomes as well! For some structures, you can change the maximum and minimum y value that they can start their generation at and far more! Check out the config for everything you can do!

<br/>
<br/>

Furthermore, you can make datapacks to modify or change a huge amount of stuff in my mod including modifying how structures look! Here's a flat world of all the pieces of my nbt-based structures. Use this to make editing and overriding structure pieces easier with datapacks:
[Repurposed Structures - pieces world (click here)](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.10)

<br/>
<br/>

All the tags this mod uses are under data.repurposed_structures.tags.blocks and you can specify more than one block. The json tag files you can override can be found at:
[Block Tags for Repurposed Structures (click here)](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/repurposed_structures/tags/blocks)

<br/>
<br/>

If you want to change the loot tables that the structures in this mod uses, you can override my loot tables with a data pack! Here's a datapack with the default loot tables: [
Repurposed_Structures-Loottables (click here)](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.11)

<br/>
<br/>

The mob spawner for all none-nbt based structures can be changed with datapacks as well! You can download the spawner datapack here and change the entries inside the json files to add, remove, or change mob chances in spawners!:
[Repurposed_Structures-Mob_Spawners (click here)](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.5)

<br/>
<br/>

And some structure pieces such as Wells, Villages, Outposts, Shipwrecks, Pyramids, and Igloos can also be overridden with datapacks. Furthermore, the template pools that holds structure pieces for Villages and other structures can also be overridden with datapacks to add your own pieces to the villages or other structures! You can find what pieces or pools can be replaced and their filenames here:
[Overridable structure nbt files (click here)](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/repurposed_structures/structures)
[Overridable structure pool files (click here)](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/repurposed_structures/worldgen)
</details>

<br/>
<br/>

Let me know if you think of a new config option that you would need and I will try and add it! :)

______________________________________________________________________________

# PRE-MADE DATAPACKS


Since the overwhelming majority of my structures uses nbt files, template pools, and/or processors, you can override all of this with datapacks! That means you can customize the blocks in those structures with other mod's blocks or add pieces of other mod's villages into RS's villages! If you decide to use the datapack below, download it, go into your world's save folder, and put the zipped folder into the datapack folder. Now when you load the game, the datapack should take effect! (Also, you can share mod-compat datapacks you made to me and I'll add it below after I check it out and like it!)

<br/>
<br/>
