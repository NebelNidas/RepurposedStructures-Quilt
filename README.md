# Repurposed Structures (Fabric Port)
This project's intention was to port the Quilt-only 1.18.2+ versions of Repurposed Structure back to Fabric, as there was absolutely no technical necessity to switch mod loaders. In the meantime however, it looks like TelepathicGrunt has reversed the decision to go Quilt-exclusive, so this fork is no longer necessary and has been archived.
