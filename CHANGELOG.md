### **(V.4.0.0 Changes) (1.18.2 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Ported to 1.18.2 mc and rewritten a massive portion of this mod to use the new json structure system mojang added!
 You can now make entirely new structures with datapack! 

#### Config:
Most configs were deleted and moved to the new json system. This include spawnrates, disabling structures, 
 what biomes a structure can spawn in, adding mob map trades, and more! There's many new configurations also
 available by datapack in the new json system that was previously not avaliable before. 

Structures are now based on biome tags for what biomes they spawn in. Please let me know if RS structures are not
 spawning in a modded or datapack biome as they will need to add their biomes to specific biome tags.

#### Witch Huts:
All Witch Huts' internal ConfiguredStructure name is changed from `witch_huts_` to now `witch_hut_`.
 Plural `witch_huts_` will continue to be used for all other json files.

#### Villages:
Dark Forest Village's internal name was changed from `village_dark_oak` to now `village_dark_forest`.
