### **(V.6.0.4 Changes) (1.19.0 Minecraft)**

Changed dungeons to use `repurposed_structures:unlimited_count` so you can set dungeon spawnrates insanely high (like a thousand or so)
 Config datapack is updated with these changes.

#### Wells:
Added `repurposed_structures:unlimited_count` to wells to make turning them off easier (just set count to 0)
 Config datapack is updated with these changes.

### **(V.6.0.0 Changes) (1.19.0 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Updated to 1.19! Beta as there could be issues. Please report anything funky or broken!
 Note: previous config datapacks will not work as many changes were done to structure json by Mojang.
 The updated RS Config datapack for 1.19 will be posted here: https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/2.0.1

Version 5.x.x is skipped to 6.0.0 so this fabric version syncs up with the forge versioning. 
 Makes it easier to see who's up-to-date at a glance in logs.

#### Config:
The Dungeons and Wells config files that used to be in the mod config folder are now deleted.
 Instead, they are now made with json and can be disabled by editing the config datapack listed above.

#### Dungeons:
Fixed End Dungeons always having 2 Shulker Boxes. Now it's typically 1 but can be 0 or 2 at times.

#### Mineshafts:
Swamp Mineshaft now uses blocks from Mangrove Swamp and will spawn in that biome.

#### Villages:
Swamp Village now uses blocks from Mangrove Swamp and will spawn in that biome.
