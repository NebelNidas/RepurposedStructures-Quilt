##### Mineshafts:
* All of RS's Mineshafts are now Jigsaw Structures so you can use datapacks to add new nbt pieces to it or customize it even more!

* All 3 Nether Mineshafts have higher chance of Chest Minecarts.

* End Mineshafts have much higher rate of Chest Minecarts but also has far more Endermite Spawners to make it dangerous.

* Overworld Mineshafts are less likely to be cutoff by water and instead, will attempt to go through the liquid and wall it off instead.
  Ocean Mineshafts will do the same but for air instead.

* Swamp And Dark Forest Mineshaft has been split up into two separate Mineshafts. Swamp Mineshaft and Dark Forest Mineshaft.

* Crimson, Warped, Jungle, Dark Forest, and Swamp Mineshafts will have a higher chance of taller climbable plants in their 2 floor pillar piece so you can climb to the next floor.

* The breakage and decay in Jungle Fortress can be found throughout the fortress. Even in underground tunnels now.

##### Strongholds:
* Removed Stonebricks Strongholds because Better Strongholds mod exists!
  Use that epic mod instead of upgrade the Overworld Stronghold!

* The ends of the Nether Stronghold will now never have a wall of flowing lava anymore!

  Their config default distance between spawn attempts was changed from 85 to 100 as well to spread them out a bit. 

* Nether Stronghold is now in the last generation stage in order to try and prevent other structures from eating at the stronghold. 

##### Outposts:
* Modernized all Outposts Pieces which should help make their small feature pieces spawn more.

* Expanded all RS's Overworld Outposts boundaries so that Pillagers should now spawn more often over time.

* Fixed Jungle Outpost not importing modded loot.

* Added Jungle, Ocean, Giant Tree Taiga, Flower Forest, and Mushroom Pyramids!

##### Mansions:
* Added lang entry for Savanna Mansions Maps.

##### Misc:
* Removed the giant boulder feature because it isn't close to a structure and doesn't fit this mod.

* Borrowed Lithium's VoxelShapes mixin for LithiumDoublePairList in order to optimize creation of jigsaw structure bounding boxes a bit when Lithium isn't on. Use that mod tho if you can!

* Added a new system where multiple datapacks can add new structure pieces to any pool file! 
 Instead of overwriting the pool file at 
 `data\repurposed_structures\worldgen\template_pool\village\birch\houses.nbt`
 datapacks can swap the worldgen\template_pool part of the path to pool_additions like this
 `data\repurposed_structures\pool_additions\village\birch\houses.nbt`
 Now my mod will detect these pool files and merge its entries to the template_pool of the same path!
 This allows you to stack multiple datapacks using this systme without needing to merge their template_pool files together by hand.
 (Fun fact, this actually will work for other mod's template_pools too if Repurposed Structures is on)
