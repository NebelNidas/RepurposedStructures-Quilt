### **(V.2.0.0 Changes) (1.17.0 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
* Updated to 1.17!!! Note, putting this mod on a world made with 1.16.5 or older Repurposed Structures may cause weird stuff.

* File paths in the resources/data folder has been significantly redone to be more consistant and cleaner. 
  1.16.5 or older datapacks for Repurposed Structures may not work anymore and have to be updated.

##### Pool Additions:
* Will now print out to the logs if a merging pool has a typo in its nbt file entries.
