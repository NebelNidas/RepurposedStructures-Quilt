### **(V.2.4.2 Changes) (1.17.1 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Slightly adjusted look of Church (temple) piece in Mushroom Villages.

##### Misc:
RS structures that would've been cut off by world bottom will be offset upward so that they are now longer cut off.
 (Helps prevents End-themed Better Stronghold from being cut off when using Better Stronghold Compat datapack)


### **(V.2.4.1 Changes) (1.17.1 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Fixed a street not spawning in Badlands Villages.

Adjusted some zombie terminator pool files so that they are used now for many zombie variant RS Villages.

Adjusted many RS Village's terminator pieces to make absolutely sure they cannot spawn the wrong village's street to prevent other village's buildings from spawning in extremely rare edge cases.

Fixed Zombie Giant Taiga Village spawning non-zombie pieces.

Fixed Zombie Warped Village spawning non-zombified Piglins.


### **(V.2.4.0 Changes) (1.17.1 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Mushroom Villages are now added to Mushroom category biomes!

Fixed Mountains Villages very very rarely spawn Savanna Village pieces.

Fixed Swamp and Giant Tree Taiga Villages very very rarely spawn Plains Village pieces.

Removed a lot of the randomly placed Red Sand blocks from Badlands Villages to make them look a lot cleaner.

##### Mod Compat:
Houses added to RS's villages from the official mod compat datapacks will now only spawn more more than once for a single village.
 This will greatly help prevent RS's villages from becoming overloaded with multiple modded houses from the datapacks.
