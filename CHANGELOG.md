### **(V.2.4.0 Changes) (1.17.1 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Mushroom Villages are now added to Mushroom category biomes!

Fixed Mountains Villages very very rarely spawn Savanna Village pieces.

Fixed Swamp and Giant Tree Taiga Villages very very rarely spawn Plains Village pieces.

Removed a lot of the randomly placed Red Sand blocks from Badlands Villages to make them look a lot cleaner.

##### Mod Compat:
Houses added to RS's villages from the official mod compat datapacks will now only spawn more more than once for a single village.
 This will greatly help prevent RS's villages from becoming overloaded with multiple modded houses from the datapacks.
